To get the **"Scheme Name"** and **"Asset Value fields"** only from the given URL amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt, the script prints the 4th and 5th fields, which contain the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields, for all lines after the first 3 lines (which contain header information).
After the script has been successfully completed, the script saves the extracted data to the **"output.csv"** file, present in this folder, and deletes the temporary file.

The output is as follows:
